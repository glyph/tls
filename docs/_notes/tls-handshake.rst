Hello Messages
==============

- ClientHello and ServerHello establish:

  - Protocol version

  - Session ID

  - Cipher suite

  - Compression method

- And generate:

  - ClientHello.random

  - ServerHello.random

- When the client sends a ClientHello to server, it can either respond with a ServerHello, or ignore it, leading to a fatal error and the closing of the connection.

2.Server:
=========

- Certificate:

  - If it is to be authenticated

- ServerKeyExchange:

  - If server doesn’t have a certificate, or

  - if server’s certificate is for signing only

- CertificateRequest:

  - If:

    - server is authenticated, and

    - it is appropriate to the cipher suite selected

- ServerHelloDone:

  - To indicate that the hello-message phase of the handshake is complete

3.Client:
=========

- Certificate:

  - If the server sent a CertificateRequest

- ClientKeyExchange:

  - The content of this message depends on the public key algorithm selected between ClientHello and ServerHello

- CertificateVerify:

  - If the client certificate sent is with signing ability

- Digitally signed

  - Verifies the possession of private key in certificate

- ChangeCipherSpec:

  - Send this and copy the pending cipher spec into the current cipher spec

- Finished

  - Sent under the new algorithms, keys, and secrets

4.Server:
=========

- ChangeCipherSpec:

  - Send this and copy the pending cipher spec into the current cipher spec

- Finished

  - Sent under the new cipher spec


Session Resumption:

     - <wait for Server's Finished>
     - .. compound:: Check session cache for a match.

       - If the session ID is not found:

         - Generate a new session ID and perform a full handshake

       - If the session ID is found:

         - Is willing to re-establish the connection under the specified session state:

           - If No:

             - Generate a new session ID and perform a full handshake


           - If Yes, proceed to 3.

     - <wait for server’s Finished>
     - .. compound:: Send:
       - ServerHello

     - .. compound:: Send:
       - [ChangeCipherSpec]
       - Finished
     - <wait for client’s Finished>

1.Client:
=========

- ClientHello:

  - Sent using the session ID of the session to be resumed.

3.Server:
=========

- ServerHello:

  - Sent with the same Session ID value (as in the ClientHello message).

----

   `*` Indicates optional or situation-dependent messages that are not always
   sent.

   Note: To help avoid pipeline stalls, ChangeCipherSpec is an
   independent TLS protocol content type, and is not actually a TLS
   handshake message.
